            <h3> Frost </h3> 
            <p> Most of the movies on this streaming service are not amazing, but I keep paying for it because: 
                A) It's pretty cheap and B) on occasion, there are some amazing gems! Phil Tippet's Mad God is a wild ride, and worth 
                the price of admission alone.

            <p> They have all sorts of stuff that I would never have encountered outside of this service, and the originals and 
                exclusives are neat to go through. If you think you will watch at least two horror movies a month I think this service is worth it.
